## Introduction
This project from [Data Science for Social Good Munich](https://sites.google.com/view/dssgx-munich-2023/startseite) aims to create dataset regarding land use in Germany.
It also contains some visualizations and analysis of the dataset.


As comprehensive dataset of land use in Germany is not available, this project aims to create a dataset that can be used for further analysis and research. The dataset is extracted from local landuse plans and regional from NRW in Germany. 

The dataset is available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DSSGxMunich/nrw-bplan-scrape/tree/main).
To use this project you must download the data from there and unzip data.zip at the root directory.
