This is the documentation for the DSSGx Munich Land Sealing Dataset project. The project aims to
create a dataset that helps to understand the drivers of land sealing in Germany.


The dataset is extracted from local landuse plans from states in Germany.
Currently, focussed on the state North Rhine Westphalia (NRW). The data is located the `Open Geodata NRW Portal <https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/infrastruktur_bauen_wohnen/bauleitplanung//>`_.
