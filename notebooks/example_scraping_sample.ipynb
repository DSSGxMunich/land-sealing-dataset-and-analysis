    "+ **parse_geojson:** parses geojson file with download links to different building plans. It iterates over all rows and checks if the url matches the pattern of a osp-plan.de link without a list format, meaning than the scan url is not directly to a pdf, but the pdf is contained somewhere in the html of the page. If the url matches the pattern, the html of the page is downloaded and parsed with beautiful soup. All links that start with https://www.o-sp.de/download/ are extracted and written to a dataframe.\n",
